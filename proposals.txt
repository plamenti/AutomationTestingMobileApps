Java lint checker
http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/

How to tun checkstyle
From View display Gradle and from it run checkstyle (could be run against main or test)

If testing is on many devices - e.g. 200 devices:
Appium + SauceLabs

Artifacts to gather:
Screenshots
Logcat
junit styxml style reporting
HTML report with pictures - expected pic, actual pic, differences

XCode - program that iOS app are developed with
To install XCode
NAvigate to App store
Search for XCode

Tricks for iPhone testing:
Test on iPhone X and on iPhone that is not X (e.g. 7)

IN iOS name and label are playing role of id

Always zip app files - they are folders 

Selenium id == Android content description resource id == iOS name


HW
Run the Framework
Refactor IFs
Implement screenshot capture logic

After Test fail take following artifacts:
Screenshots
page source (xml)

Good practice is to save artifacts in folder, that is cleaned and created by Maven or Gradle:
For Maven - 
For Gradle - build folder

Common reason for image comparison failures 
Video cards add one pixel through borders, that is different according the card. 
Solution is to use some different pixel similarity. 


To execute tests in CI build Gradle tasks
From console (for WIndows ): ./gradlew <name of the task>

Important - change Java version

On UNIX systems is possible Gradle to can not find some Environment variables (e.g. ANDROID_HOME) - the reason is that environment variable is set only for User.
